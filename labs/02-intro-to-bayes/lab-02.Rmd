In class, you saw the Binomial-Beta model. We will now use this to solve a very real problem! Suppose I wish to determine whether the probability that a worker will fake an illness is truly 1\%. Your task is to assist me! Tasks 1--2 will be completed in lab and tasks 3--5 should be completed in your weekly homework assignment. 

# Task 1

Let's start by quickly deriving the Beta-Binomial distribution. 

We assume that 
$$X\mid \theta \sim \text{Binomial} (\theta)$$,
$$\theta \sim \text{Beta}(a,b),$$
where $a,b$ are assumed to be known parameters. What is the posterior distribution of $\theta \mid X$?

\begin{align}
p(\theta \mid X) &\propto 
p(X \mid \theta) p(\theta) \\
&\propto \theta^{x} 
(1 - \theta)^{(n-x)} \times \theta^{(a-1)} (1 - \theta)^{(b-1)}\\
&\propto \theta^{x + a -1} (1 - \theta)^{(n-x + b -1)}.
\end{align}

This implies that 
$$\theta \mid X \sim \text{Beta}(x+a,n-x+b).$$



# Task 2

Simulate some data using the \textsf{rbinom} function of size $n = 100$ and probability equal to 1\%. Remember to \textsf{set.seed(123)} so that you can replicate your results.

The data can be simulated as follows:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
# set a seed
set.seed(123)
# create the observed data
obs.data <- rbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = 0.01)
# inspect the observed data
head(obs.data)
tail(obs.data)
length(obs.data)
```

# Task 3

Write a function that takes as its inputs that data you simulated (or any data of the same type) and a sequence of $\theta$ values of length 1000 and produces Likelihood values based on the Binomial Likelihood. Plot your sequence and its corresponding Likelihood function.

The likelihood function is given below. Since this is a probability and is only valid over the interval from $[0, 1]$ we generate a sequence over that interval of length 1000.

You have a rough sketch of what you should do for this part of the assignment. Try this out in lab on your own. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
### Bernoulli LH Function ###
# Input: obs.data, theta
# Output: bernoulli likelihood


### Plot LH for a grid of theta values ###
# Create the grid #
# Store the LH values
# Create the Plot
```
